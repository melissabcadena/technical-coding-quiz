# Technical Coding Quiz

## Purpose
A website that was created to allowed a user to test their technical coding knowledge with a short, timed quiz. Using DOM Elements and JavaScript, I have created a quick quiz quiz that deducts time if a question is answered incorrectly. High scores and users initials can be saved to localStorage if users would like to continue to play and improve their score. All scores saved to localStorage can be seen on the High Scores page.
